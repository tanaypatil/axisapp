        Every festival has darker shades to it, an underbelly that is not always visible to the eye.
        So, is the case with Holi, the festival of colours. AXIS’16, conducted a heart-warming city-wide
        series called Colours of Nagpur, wherein we brought to light the stories of those who go unnoticed,
        unheeded working relentlessly as the rest of the city was revelling in the spirit of Holi. Nurses,
        petrol pump workers, traffic policemen, airport staff, the ‘Coolie’ at the train station, we covered
        them all. Just a simple act of being a good patient listener showed that we cared.

        Addressing the increasing levels of youngsters taking to smoking, AXIS\'16 took social media
        by storm. All it took for you to show your solidarity for the campaign, was to change your
        Facebook and Whatsapp profile pictures to the #ISayNoToSmoking poster for a day. With
        thousands of students across the country volunteering, we hope to have made a small
        difference among the college campus communities.

        Does it sadden you to watch trees being felled only to pave the way to concrete jungles? If
        it does, the My Tree, My Friend initiative by AXIS\'16 was just the place for you to have been.
         My Tree, My Friend was a Nagpur city-wide attempt to open the Nagpurian\'s eyes as to how
        their once green, tree lined city was fast urbanizing into yet another grey, polluted,
        metropolis. Following on the lines of the friendship day trend of tying ribbons to one’s
        friends, the students of VNIT instead each befriended a tree by tying a green ribbon around
        it. The green ribbon, signified a promise of protection in the face of deforestation, from
        the younger generation to the good old trees whose shade they had grown up under.

        The dream that we all hope comes true someday is that there should be no reason to celebrate
        a day such as World Day against Child Labour.  AXIS’16, performed street plays across Nagpur
        in prime youth hotspots such as malls and parks igniting the fire in the educated youth of
        the city, to rise and fight against this inhuman and cruel practice. The street plays received
        an overwhelming response from people of all walks of life.
